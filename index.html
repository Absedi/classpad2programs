            <h1>Annoushya's CASIO ClassPad II Stuff</h1>
        </header>

        <p>First thing's first: Thanks for dropping in!</p>
        <p>This site's a bit scuffed at the moment, but I'll have it cleaned up eventually. For the purposes of this site, "eventually" means some point before the heat death of the universe, not necessarily preceding my cremation.</p>
        <p>Long story short, I wrote up some custom programs for my CASIO ClassPad II last year for my Maths Methods Unit 1/2 course. I thought they were <span class="contains-tooltip">pretty niffty*,</span> <span class="tooltip">(this is my humble-brag way of saying I think they're really awesome and useful and fantastic and you should totally use them, for the record)</span> so I figured, hey, why not share them?</p>
        <p>After all, my crippling need for validation from others far exceeds any logical and/or rational impulses I get telling me "Psst, hey, are you <i>sure</i> you, uhh, don't want to just... Keep these to yourself for a competitive advantage?"</p>

        <h2>Download Links</h2>
        <h3>Standalone</h3>
        <p><a href="cas-programs-for-download\AutDeriv-(Program).xcp" download>AutDeriv</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When run:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Defines g(x) as the derivative of f(x)</li>
                <li>Defines h(x) as the second-order derivative of f(x)</li>
                <li>Returns a list containing g(x) and h(x)'s new values as the first and second items respectively so you can copy them down easily if prompted to do so by a question</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Will stick a quick demo video/screenshots in here later, rushing to get this website in before midnight for boba drop lmao and don't have CASIO Screen Receiver set up on this laptop</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Not Standalone (Requires dependencies which I list later)</h3>
        <p><a href="cas-programs-for-download\AGraph-(Program).xcp" download>AGraph</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demo video comparing this program to nhan whitecas' keypts function: (I don't think I need to say that I am self-centered and think mine is better)</li>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="media\2024-12-21 12-05-18.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <li>weejio shows pretty much every aspect of the thing so i'll write up a proper description later, yippee kai yay</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>This is the exact same as the nhan whitecas thing, you don't have to do anything if you already have it downloaded</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>This one is 100% my own program, so you're gonna have to download it, yeah</li>
                <li>Unrelated note, but holy hell, I am SO mad that I had to write up this thing and that it wasn't already included by default as a CASIO Basic function. Like, WHAT? It's such a basic QOL aspect of any programming language, I literally can't</li>
